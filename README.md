# My Personal Blog

This is the repository for my personal blog, built using GatsbyJS. The blog serves as a platform for me to share my experiences and knowledge about programming, computer graphics, and the journey through grad school.

## Description

In this blog, I cover a range of topics that I'm passionate about. From discussing different programming languages and techniques to exploring the complexities of computer graphics, I aim to provide insights that can be valuable to others in the field. I also delve into my experiences in grad school, offering a personal perspective that might resonate with others on the same path.

## Reuse

While this blog represents my personal journey, I encourage anyone who finds the code useful to utilize it as a basis for their own projects. This could be a great starting point if you're looking to build a similar blog or platform.

Thanks for visiting my repository!
